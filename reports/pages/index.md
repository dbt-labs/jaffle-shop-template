### Customer Cohorts
Average order values are tracked using monthly cohorts, which are created by truncating `first_order_date` to month. 

```customers_with_cohort
select
    *,
    date_trunc('month', first_ordered_at) as cohort_month,
    lifetime_spend_pretax / count_lifetime_orders as average_order_value_usd0

from analytics.customers
```

```cohorts_aov
select
    cohort_month,
    avg(average_order_value_usd0) as cohort_aov_usd

from ${customers_with_cohort}

group by 1
order by cohort_month
```

<BarChart
    data={cohorts_aov}
    x=cohort_month
    y=cohort_aov_usd
    yAxisTitle="average order value"
    xAxisTitle="Monthly Cohort"
    title="Customer AOV by first month cohort"
/>

### Average Order Values

<Histogram
    data={customers_with_cohort}
